# Comsicare's SFM collection
Collection of programms for the SuperFactoryManager mod. <br>

Most of these programms were written in and specifically for ATM9. <br>

Many thanks to the developer of the SuperFactoryManager mod.<br>

I have always loved StevesFactoryManager when playing FTB:Infinity Evolved back in the day and so I am super happy that there is a proper port for the modern versions. <br>
Personally, I actually prefer the coding nature of the new SFM.<br>


## What to look out for when using this collection

> [!CAUTION]
> **Most programms will not work without adjusting the config.** 

We have adjusted the minimum tick interval on the server that I wrote most of these on. Therefore you'll find many sub 20 ticks move triggers. <br>
If you don't adjust the config in the world you wanna load them, they will fail. <br>

I am planning to gradually create default config compatible and in general more compatible versions of these programms. But many of these are just impractical with 20 tick intervals.<br> 


## TODO - Plans, maybe 

- [x] Collect all the programms I have written so far and bundle them in this repo
- [x] Add comments to all programms to make them more readable
- [x] Exchange labels with self explanatory ones 
- [] Accumulate more programms 
- [] Split off default config branch that contains only programms that will work on unmodified config
- [] If applicable; rewrite sub 20 tick programms to work with default config
