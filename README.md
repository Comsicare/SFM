# Comsicare's SFM collection
Collection of programms for the SuperFactoryManager mod. 

Most of these programms were written in and specifically for ATM9. 

Many thanks to the developer of the SuperFactoryManager mod. 

I have always loved StevesFactoryManager when playing FTB:Infinity Evolved back in the day and so I am super happy that there is a proper port for the modern versions. 
Personally, I actually prefer the coding nature of the new SFM.


## What to look out for when using this collection

**Most programms will not work without adjusting the config.** 
We have adjusted the minimum tick interval on the server that I wrote most of these on. Therefore you'll find many sub 20 ticks move triggers. If you don't adjust the config in the world you wanna load them, they will fail. 

I am planning to gradually create default config compatible and in general more compatible versions of these programms. But many of these are just impractical with 20 tick intervals. 

Feel free to use these programms when playing. If you show them off, please provide proper credit.
